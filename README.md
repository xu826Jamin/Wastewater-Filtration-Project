# Wastewater Filtration: Large-Scale Microplastic Removal

## Project Overview
[cite_start]This project focuses on the mechanical design of a sustainable filtration system for wastewater treatment plants[cite: 1356]. [cite_start]Our team specifically addressed the challenge of filtering microplastics (10-20µm) in a large-scale facility serving approximately 25,000 citizens[cite: 1465, 1479].

## Design Objective
[cite_start]The primary goal was to design a filtration component that balances high mechanical performance with minimal financial and environmental costs[cite: 1453].

### Key Specifications
- [cite_start]**Scenario**: Microplastic Filtration for a Large-Scale Plant[cite: 1635].
- [cite_start]**Primary Objective**: Minimize Cost ($/Liter filtered)[cite: 1680].
- [cite_start]**Secondary Objective**: Minimize Carbon Footprint (CO2 equivalent)[cite: 1680].
- [cite_start]**Final Material Selection**: **Hemp Fiber**[cite: 1492].

## Technical Highlights
- [cite_start]**Material Selection**: Conducted using the Ashby Method in **ANSYS-Granta EduPack**, evaluating Hemp, Flax, and Cotton fibers against derived Material Performance Indices (MPI) [cite: 1485-1491].
- [cite_start]**Porosity Design**: Calculated an optimal porosity of ~14% with a pore radius of 8µm to effectively trap microplastics while maintaining flow [cite: 1466-1469].
- [cite_start]**Sustainability (Eco-Audit)**: Hemp fiber was selected for its long lifespan and significant CO2 reduction potential during its end-of-life reuse phase [cite: 1503-1508, 1747].
